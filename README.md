# Roll20_stattracker
This is just a hobby project...
But if for whatever reason you want to try it out yourself, follow these steps

1. Go to your roll20 campaign
2. Inspect a roll for each of your players
3. Extract the player_id of each player
  as can be seen here ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48087675/188942486-0ad16ac9-754e-4b19-8dfa-030d1b43ed32.png)
4. Input the player name and their ID into the Data.py file
      **(OPTIONAL)** Input your roll20 login and password to automaticly login
5. Run the main.py file

For a rundown of possible commands, simply write ;;help, in the chat.
