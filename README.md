# Roll20_stattracker
This is just a hobby project, that me and some friends use to keep statistical track of our DnD game in roll 20.

But if for whatever reason you want to try it out yourself, follow these steps

1. Make sure the chromedriver.exe is the same version as your chrome (if not download it from here https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
2. **(OPTIONAL)** Input your roll20 login and password to the login.py file, to automatically login
3. Run the main.py file

For a rundown of possible commands, simply write ```;;help```, in the chat.
Any command can be shortened to their first letter, e.g. ```;;player``` -> ```;;p```
